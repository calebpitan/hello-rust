## Hello, Rust!

Hello Rust is one of my first Rust program. To do more than what the `cargo new` has bootstrapped the project with, I decided to add some additional piece of code that can tell if a number is odd or even when supplied a number from the `stdin` (Standard Input) console.

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

## How it started

There's this field force that draws me towards Rust, irrespective of how overwhelming its syntax may seem. What I don't understand is why Golang still repels me. Rust is probably the way to go!

I've tried C/C++ a number of times, molded it into clay, thrown it on the wall, but it won't just stick. I even once danced with the devil&mdash;Visual C++&mdash;nothing good came out of that, just intimidation. What I won't do is give up coming very close to a computer, as close as one layer above Assembly code, so I hopped right on the Rust train.

It's going to be quite a rough journey&mdash;damn sure it is! You will know when I done get a very good grasp of Rust 'cause it will be me rustling and bustling everywhere ðŸ˜Ž.

## How it's going

I still haven't got a tight grasp of References. Hang in there, 'cause I'm trying to think out of the box ðŸš€!
